# MMA-Datathon-2025

This is the Repository for the MMA 2025 Datathon

## Challenge

Build a dta-drive model that examines the relationship between rising living costs, economic development and supply chain performance to address the following:

1. How does the rising cost of living impact supply chain stability and costs?
2. What economic and regional factors contribute to cost increases within supply chains?
3. How can organizations adapt supply chain strategies to mitigate the effects of rising costs on consumers?

### Correlational Insights

1. What Patterns Emerge between cost-of-living increases and supply chain disruptions
2. Are certain regions or industries more susceptible?

### Supply Chain Resilience Modelling

1. Which economic indicators most strong impact supply chain costs?
2. How can these insights guide predictions of supply chain challenges?

### Strategic Recommendations:

Provide recommendations for businesses and policymakers to help ensure that supply chains remain stable and cost-effective even as living costs and economic pressures rise.

1. What adaptations can businesses make to their supply chains to buffer against cost increases?

## Data

### Cost of Living Data

- **consumer Price Index (CPI)**: Tracks changes in the prive level of a market basket of consumer goods and services
- **Cost of Living Index**: Includes various cost-of-living factors, such as rent, food prices, and average household costs by city and country.

### Economic Development indicators

- **Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per Capita**: Assesses the economic output per person in a region
- **Human Development Index (HDI)**: A composite of life expectancy, education, and income, giving a broad view of development
- **Gini Coefficient**: Reflects income inequality, indicating economic disparity
- **Unemployment Rate**: Tracks economic stability and employment trends

### Supply Chain Metrics and Indices
- **Producer Price Index (PPI)**: Measures changes in selling prices received by domestic producers for their output, directly reflecting production costs
- **Logistics Performance Index (LPI)**: Assesses a countryâ€™s logistics environment, crucial for understanding supply chain resilience
- **Freight Rate Indices**: Tracks shipping and transport costs, crucial as transportation is often impacted by cost-of-living changes
- **Supply Chain Volatility Index**: Measures fluctuations in supply chain stability, helping identify which sectors are most affected by rising costs

### Household Income and Expenditure Data
- **Average Household Income**: Provides insight into purchasing power and disposable income, impacting demand and supply chain dynamics
- **Household Expenditure Data**: Helps identify consumer behavior changes in response to rising costs, which impact supply chain demand
